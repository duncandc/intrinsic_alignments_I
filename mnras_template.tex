% Abstract of the paper
\begin{abstract}
Galaxies exhibit alignments with both close neighbours and the large scale structure.  The nature of intrinsic alignments is interesting for both testing galaxy formation models and in cosmological probes of dark energy.  Any intrinsic alignment between galaxies may be a significant source of systematic error in cosmological probes of dark energy which rely on weak lensing.  Because upcoming surveys rely on photometric redshifts, some lens and source galaxies may be physically close, and any intrinsic alignment between galaxies will masquerade as a lensing signal.  In this series of papers, we present a flexible, empirical, halo based model of intrinsic alignments of galaxies.  In this first paper, we examine the necessary components and phenomenology of such a model by examining the alignments between (sub-)haloes in a cosmological dark matter only simulation.  The primary assumption of our model is that galaxies exhibit an alignment with their host dark matter (sub-)halo.  By modelling the misalignment between galaxies orientations and their host halo, we show that (sub-)halo two-point position and shape correlation functions can be accurately reproduced down to $0.1~h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$.  To model the small scale alignments of dark matter sub-haloes, a radial alignment model is sufficient when combined with a model for satellite anisotropy.   \end{abstract}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% BODY OF PAPER %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Introduction}

We extend the halo based model for alignments presented in \citet{Schneider:2010cg}.

\section{Halo Model}

\beq
\tpcf{gg}(r) = \tpcftwo{gg}{1h}(r) + \tpcftwo{gg}{2h}(r)
\eeq

\beq
\tpcftwo{gg}{1h}(r) = \tpcftwo{cs}{1h}(r) + \tpcftwo{ss}{1h}(r) 
\eeq

\beq
\tpcftwo{gg}{2h}(r) =  \tpcftwo{cc}{1h}(r) + \tpcftwo{cs}{1h}(r) + \tpcftwo{ss}{1h}(r) 
\eeq

\begin{align}
\tpcftwo{gg}{2h}(r) =   \frac{1}{\bar{n}_{\rm g}^{2}}\int\dd M_1 \int\dd M_2 & \frac{\rm dn}{\dd M_1}\frac{\rm dn}{\dd M_2} \tpcf{hh}(r\vert M_1, M_2) \\& \times  \meantwo{N_{\rm g}}{M_1} \meantwo{N_{\rm g}}{M_2}. 
\end{align}

\begin{align}
\tpcftwo{gg}{1h}(r) =  \frac{1}{\bar{n}_{\rm g}^{2}} \int\dd M \frac{\rm dn}{\dd M} \int\dd^{3}& x\lambda(\vec{x}\vert M)\lambda(\vec{x}+\vec{r}\vert M)\\ & \times  \meantwo{N_{\rm g}(N_{\rm g}-1)}{M}
\end{align}

%\int\dd M_1 \int\dd M_2 & \frac{\rm dn}{\dd M_2} \tpcf{hh}(r\vert M_1, M_2) \\& \times \mean{N_{\rm g}(M_1)N_{\rm g}(M_2)}. 

\subsection{Observables}

The ellipticity-direction (ED) correlation function is defined as: 
\begin{equation}
\omega(r) = \langle |\hat{e}({\bf x}) \cdot \hat{r}({\bf x})|^2 \rangle -\frac{1}{3}
\end{equation}

The ellipticity-direction (EE) correlation function is defined as: 
\begin{equation}
\eta(r) = \langle |\hat{e}({\bf x}) \cdot \hat{e}({\bf x}+{\bf r})|^2 \rangle -\frac{1}{3}
\end{equation}

\section{Methods}

We use a Dimroth-Watson distribution to model the misalignment between subhalo orientation and the radial vector between the host-halo centre and the subhalo.   
\begin{equation}
P(\theta,\phi) = \frac{B(\kappa)}{2\pi}e^{-\kappa\cos^2(\theta)}\sin(\theta)\mathrm{d}\theta\mathrm{d}\phi
\label{eq:watson}
\end{equation}
